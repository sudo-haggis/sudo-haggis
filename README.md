# Hello! I'm Davey 👋

> "If it ain't broken... maybe we can make it better, If it's broken I can probably fix it."

Software developer with a knack for hardware innovation. I build, fix, and improve things across the digital and physical realms. Recent experiances include flying large swarms of drones, constructing off grid power systems and running the largest outdoor cinema in europe. Currently im enthusiastically pushing towards backend development, Checkout my [![Boot.dev](https://img.shields.io/badge/Boot.dev-0A0A23?style=for-the-badge)](https://boot.dev/u/sudo-haggis) while also looking at a linux based sys admin role. 

## 🔧 Tech Stack

**Backend & DevOps:** PHP, SQL, Python, Docker, BASH, Linux  
**Hardware:** 3D Printing, Electronics, Swarm Drones, Off-grid living Solutions  
**Workflow:** TMUX + NVIM + GIT in terminal (Ubuntu for now, Arch when I want to be single I guess!)

## 🏆 Cool Projects

- Flew a 500-drone light show, Gaining CAA-approved pilot status
- Built fulfillment system on the fly processing 5,000+ Christmas tree orders
- Design & print 3D solutions for real-world problems
- Create off-grid power systems for vans and remote living

## 🌱 Current Focus

- Backend Development (Python, Go, Docker, CI/CD, BASH... )
- Using GIT everywhere and anywhere all the time.
- VIM motions, Why did I not do this years ago?
- Growing vegetables, Can I use a GIT workflow with tomatoes?
